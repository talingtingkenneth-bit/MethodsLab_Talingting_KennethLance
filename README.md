Explanations:

Task 1: Greeting Method
This `void` method prints a welcoming text message to the console to start the user experience. It demonstrates how to create a simple helper method that executes a specific action without returning any data.

Task 2: Arithmetic Methods
These four methods perform standard mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers provided by the user. The division method specifically includes a safety check to prevent the program from crashing if the user attempts to divide by zero.

Task 3: Factorial Method
This function calculates the factorial of a number by multiplying integers from 2 up to the input value, returning a `long` to handle large results. It includes robust error handling to reject negative inputs and warns the user if the calculation exceeds the variable's storage capacity.

Task 4: Array Summation Method
This method accepts an array of integers as input and calculates the total sum of all the values contained within it. It utilizes an enhanced `for` loop to efficiently traverse the array elements and accumulate the final total.

Task 5: Prime Checker Method
This boolean method determines if a number is prime by checking if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. It is optimized for performance by skipping even numbers and only checking odd divisors up to the square root of the input.
